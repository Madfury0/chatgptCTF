Medium Challenge: RSA Weak Key

Challenge: The flag has been encrypted using RSA with a weak, small key. Youâ€™ll need to factorize n to retrieve p and q and use them to decrypt the message.


Details:

Public Key Modulus (n): 20988936657440586486151264256610222593863921

Public Exponent (e): 65537

Ciphertext (encrypted flag): 10737418321



---

Instructions:

1. Factorize n to obtain p and q.


2. Use these factors to compute the private key and decrypt the ciphertext to find the flag.


3. Submit the decrypted message in the format CTF{flag}.



Good luck!
