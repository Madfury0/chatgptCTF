1. ### Understand RSA Basics

RSA relies on a pair of keys (public and private). The public key consists of two components, n (modulus) and e (public exponent).

n is a product of two prime numbers, p and q. The security of RSA depends on the difficulty of factoring n into p and q.

If n is small, it's more vulnerable because factoring becomes computationally feasible.


2. ### Factorize n

Since the RSA modulus n is weak (small), it’s possible to find its prime factors (p and q).

Use online resources, Python scripts, or libraries like SymPy or PyCrypto to factorize n. Many CTF tools, like RsaCtfTool, also provide automated factoring.

Once you have p and q, you can calculate φ(n) = (p-1)(q-1).


3. ### Calculate the Private Key

Use φ(n) and the public exponent e to calculate the private key exponent d. d is the modular inverse of e with respect to φ(n).

Tools like SymPy or Python’s pow function (with three arguments) can handle modular inverses.


4. ### Decrypt the Ciphertext

Once you have d, you can decrypt the ciphertext using the formula:


The resulting plaintext should be readable and will typically contain the flag.


5. ### Format the Answer

Ensure the output matches the expected flag format (CTF{flag}).




##Tools and Commands

- Factorize: Use factorization tools or libraries (RsaCtfTool, SymPy, or any script for small n).

- Modular Arithmetic: Python’s pow(base, exp, mod) function is useful for modular exponentiation.

- Decrypting: Once d is known, plug it into the decryption formula to recover the plaintext.


This methodical approach will help you tackle RSA challenges, especially those with weak or small keys.
