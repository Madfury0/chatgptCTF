- Original generated [Prompt link] (https://chatgpt.com/share/673471fd-c1f4-8005-8085-007e254ee6c8)

Each challenge was based on what the AI termed as easy, medium and hard.

The below prompt wqs used to generate the different challenges.

> You are an expert cybersecurity professional, responsible for architecture design of unbreakable systems.
> You have tasked to come up with CTF challenges for an upcoming Hackathon.
> You are to have a minimum of 10 categories, with each having 3 challenges, from easy, medium and hard. 
> You are to list all the categories so that each participant can select a category he/she wants to start with.
> For the selected category start with a easy challenge, The participant should submit the correct flag for you to provide the next challenge in medium and following the same approach, hard. 
> After completion of hard, he/she should proceed to a different category and follow the same approach. 
> You are only to provide the challenge (code and everything and some basic instructions) and wait for the answer. The answer should be in CTF{flag} format. 
> Only when the answer is correct can on proceed to the next challenge.
> For challenges with the flag on a file, you can provide the source code and instructions on where to place the flag.



##The different catogories are as follows:

---

###Category 1: Reverse Engineering

Instructions: Use SQL injection on the login form to bypass authentication.



2. Medium: XSS with CSP Bypass

Challenge: Craft a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to leak the flag from a page protected with Content Security Policy (CSP).

Instructions: Find a CSP weakness and inject code that retrieves the flag.



3. Hard: Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)

Challenge: Exploit SSTI in a form field to retrieve the flag.

Instructions: Locate the vulnerable form and craft a payload to retrieve the hidden server variable containing the flag.




###Category 3: Cryptography

1. Easy: Caesar Cipher

Challenge: Decrypt the ciphertext encrypted with a Caesar cipher and shift key of 7.

Ciphertext: Whvwlqj

Instructions: Apply the reverse Caesar cipher technique to find the flag.



2. Medium: RSA Weak Key

Challenge: The flag is encrypted with RSA using a weak, small key. Your task is to factorize n to retrieve p and q and decrypt the message.

Instructions: Use tools like RsaCtfTool to find the factors of n and decrypt the message.



3. Hard: Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

Challenge: Given the elliptic curve parameters and a ciphertext, break the encryption to find the flag.

Instructions: Analyze the curve parameters and apply ECC attacks to decrypt the ciphertext.




###Category 4: Steganography

1. Easy: LSB Image Steganography

Challenge: Extract the hidden message from the least significant bits of a provided PNG file.

Instructions: Use tools like StegSolve to extract the LSB data and retrieve the flag.



2. Medium: Audio Steganography

Challenge: Extract the flag hidden within an audio file.

Instructions: Check the spectrogram and/or other audio steganography techniques to find the hidden data.



3. Hard: Stego in Metadata

Challenge: A PDF file contains a flag hidden in its metadata.

Instructions: Use exiftool to analyze and extract metadata from the PDF file.




###Category 5: Forensics

1. Easy: Memory Dump Analysis

Challenge: Analyze a provided memory dump to retrieve a password.

Instructions: Use volatility or other memory analysis tools to find the password and retrieve the flag.



2. Medium: Disk Image Extraction

Challenge: Extract the flag hidden in a provided disk image (e.g., .img file).

Instructions: Mount or analyze the image file to extract files or data containing the flag.



3. Hard: Packet Capture Analysis

Challenge: Analyze a .pcap file to find sensitive data transferred over the network, containing the flag.

Instructions: Use Wireshark to analyze the traffic and locate the flag.




###Category 6: OSINT (Open Source Intelligence)

1. Easy: Twitter Search

Challenge: A certain user tweeted the flag on a public account. Find and submit it.

Instructions: Use advanced Twitter search techniques to locate the tweet containing the flag.



2. Medium: Public GitHub Repository

Challenge: The flag is hidden in a public GitHub repository.

Instructions: Use search filters on GitHub to locate and retrieve the flag.



3. Hard: Dark Web Investigation

Challenge: Locate a flag hidden on a Tor site.

Instructions: Use Tor and dark web search techniques to find the flag.




###Category 7: Programming

1. Easy: Basic Python Script Analysis

Challenge: A Python script generates a flag based on a simple mathematical calculation.

Instructions: Review and run the script to retrieve the flag.



2. Medium: Buffer Overflow Exploit

Challenge: Exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in a C program to leak the flag.

Instructions: Find the vulnerable function and craft an input payload to exploit it.



3. Hard: Binary Exploitation (Format String Vulnerability)

Challenge: Exploit a format string vulnerability in a binary to retrieve the flag.

Instructions: Analyze the binary and construct an input that reveals the flag.





###Category 8: Miscellaneous
